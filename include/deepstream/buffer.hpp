	 * This implementation instead of a typedef allows the forward declaration
	 * of Buffer. Also, the buffer can be constructed directly from strings.
	 *
	 * This functions uses std::vector<char> because vector<T>::data() returns
	 * sequential, writable memory while std::string::data() returns a pointer
	 * to const (before C++17); this kind of memory access is needed for
	 * - the scanner (sequential storage),
	 * - reading from sockets (sequential, writable), and
	 * - writing to sockets (sequential).
	 * Since C++11, std::string has to use sequential storage. Hence, we might
	 * use &string[0] to access the underlying storage but ChristophC preferred
	 * std::vector<char> over std::string.
